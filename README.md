## Dev instruction

To develop on your computer, checkout a new Git branch and do your work. **Do not develop on the master branch!**

Before you upload your work, please invite someone to do a code review.

Every time you want to upload your work, please first checkout to master branch and pull:

```bash
gco master
git pull --rebase origin master
```

Then merge your branch to master branch:

```
git merge --squash your-branch-name
```

First solve the conflict (if there's any). Then add, commit, and push to the master.
